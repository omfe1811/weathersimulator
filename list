Objective:
Create a dynamic weather simulation that changes the weather conditions every 3 minutes. Your
goal is to design and implement a solution that updates the weather on the screen automatically
without using buttons and provides warnings for extreme weather.
Problem Statement:
1. Weather Data:
o Create an object to represent the current weather with the following properties:
▪ Temperature: A number between -10°C and 40°C.
▪ Condition: One of the following: "Clear," "Rain," or "Snow."
▪ Cloudiness: A percentage (e.g., 20%, 50%, etc.).

2. Automatic Updates:
o Find a way to change the weather conditions automatically every 3 minutes.
o Think about how to repeatedly call a function without using any manual triggers
(like a button).
3. Random Weather Generator:
o Write a function that randomly updates the values of the weather object:
▪ Generate a random temperature.
▪ Randomly pick a weather condition.
▪ Generate a random cloudiness percentage.

4. Displaying Weather:
o Use HTML to display the weather properties on the screen:
▪ Temperature.
▪ Weather condition.
▪ Cloudiness.
o Dynamically update the displayed weather whenever it changes.
5. Visual Feedback:
o Use CSS to style the display.
o Change the background color or add effects (e.g., a gradient, animations) to
represent different weather conditions.
6. Extreme Weather Warning:
o If the weather is Snow and the temperature is below -10°C, display a message:
“Do not go outside!”
o Think about how you will detect this condition and update the message on the
screen.

Challenge Questions:
1. How can you ensure the weather updates automatically at regular intervals?
2. What is the best way to generate random values for the weather properties?
3. How can you dynamically check for extreme weather conditions and update warnings?
4. How will you structure the CSS so the warning message stands out?
Hints:
• Use a JavaScript method that executes code repeatedly after a certain time.
• Use conditionals (if statements) to check for extreme weather conditions.
• Use DOM manipulation to update both the weather display and the warning message
dynamically.
